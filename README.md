# Advent of C 2023

Advent of code 2023 done with members of Computer Science House to solve each
challenge in C. Each solution will be in 1.c and 2.c, and read from stdin.

## Time to solution & Lines of Code:

## Asterisks

Day 2: I started ~15 minutes after midnight

Day 6: I started at 12:57 because I was working on homework and didn't realize the time.
I'm so sad cause this one was so easy too. I could easily have gotten a top 1000 score
if I didn't have such a skill issue with the time.

Day 7: Skill issue

Day 8: I realized the way to solve this one was not brute force, and used an LCM
calculator online to find the correct answer (for speed). 08/2.c does not produce 
an answer, but it does produce the necessary components for an answer.
